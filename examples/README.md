# Messaging for In-App SDK: Android Examples

We provide the following example apps to demonstrate common uses for the Messaging for In-App SDK.

- [Simple UI SDK Example](./MessagingBasicExample/): A simple messaging app that uses the UI SDK to start a messaging session with an agent. To get started, download the app and update the `configFile.json` file with your embedded service deployment information. Since this example uses the UI SDK, the basic user experience including any pre-chat form fields, are handled by the SDK. To learn more about the UI SDK, see [Use the UI SDK for Android](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/service/messaging-in-app/guide/android-ui-sdk.html).
- [Simple Core SDK Example](./MessagingCoreExample/): A simple Core SDK example that shows you how to send and receive messages with the Core SDK. To get started, download the app and update the `configFile.json` file with your embedded service deployment information. This example assumes that you don't have a pre-chat form enabled. If you do, you'll need to write additional code to handle pre-chat form fields. To learn more about the Core SDK, see [Use the Core SDK for Android](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/service/messaging-in-app/guide/android-core-sdk.html).
