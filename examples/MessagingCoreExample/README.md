# Messaging for In-App Android SDK: Simple Core SDK Example

A simple Core SDK example that shows you how to send and receive messages with the Core SDK. To get started, download the app and update the `configFile.json` file with your embedded service deployment information. This example assumes that you don't have a pre-chat form enabled. If you do, you'll need to write additional code to handle pre-chat form fields. To learn more about the Core SDK, see [Use the Core SDK for Android](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/service/messaging-in-app/guide/android-core-sdk.html).
